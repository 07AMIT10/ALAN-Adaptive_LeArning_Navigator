This ensures that the learning path is not just a generic outline, but a personalized guide designed to effectively bridge the gap between the user's current knowledge and their learning goals.

3. **Content Enrichment via Secure Backend Proxies:**  
   To make each module rich and actionable, ALAN employs **secure backend proxies** to dynamically enrich the roadmap with high-quality learning resources:
   - **Relevant Videos (YouTube Data API):**  Embedded videos, sourced via the YouTube Data API, provide visual explanations, demonstrations, and alternative perspectives on complex concepts.
   - **Curated Articles (Google Custom Search API):**  Carefully selected articles, fetched using the Google Custom Search API, offer in-depth written content, diverse viewpoints, and up-to-date information, catering to different learning styles and preferences.

4. **Interactive Exploration and Self-Paced Learning:**  
   The roadmap is presented as an **interactive graph**, inviting users to actively engage with the learning material. This interactive visualization empowers users to:
   - **Explore Modules at Their Own Pace:**  Users are not confined to a linear path; they can freely navigate the roadmap, choosing modules that pique their interest or address their immediate learning needs.
   - **Dive Deeper into Content:** By clicking on individual modules, users can access detailed information, including module overviews and (in future iterations) curated learning resources, facilitating a deeper understanding of each topic.

5. **Progress Tracking and Visual Motivation:**  
   ALAN incorporates **visual indicators** to track learning progress and provide continuous motivation:
   - **Node Color Changes:**  As users mark modules as "Completed" or "Mark to Revisit," the corresponding nodes on the roadmap change color. This visual feedback provides **clear, engaging, and immediate reinforcement** of their learning progress, encouraging continued engagement and a sense of accomplishment.

## Architecture

ALAN's architecture is thoughtfully designed with a clear separation of concerns, employing a two-tier structure comprising a **React-based frontend** for user interaction and a **Flask-based backend** for secure data handling and API interactions.
